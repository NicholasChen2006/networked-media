    <h1>Wooden Door</h1>
    <p></p>

    <p>Upon first glance, the wooden door hinged on a wooden frame looks out of place. 
        Grass seems to be gnawing away at its bottom, and the boards that constitute the door itself are loose and aged.</p>
        <p>On its frame, just above the handle, a <a href="the-lab-door-note.html">small note</a> is taped to the side.</p>

  <p>The <a href="the-lab.html">doorhandle</a> is close to falling off.</p>
