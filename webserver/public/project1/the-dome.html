    <h1>The Dome</h1>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>Tiny particles of dust drift in the air, carefully nesting upon the cracked tile flooring. 
        Through the circular open window in the sky, the muted glow of cloudy grey occasionally 
        reflects upon the snowflakes drifting from the bitter outdoors. Looking up, brief gusts of 
        a wind occasionally blow bits of brown fallen leaves into the room. There's the rope you used to climb in hanging from where you left it.
        </p>
    <p class="epic">
        The room itself is a matte metallic plated dome. Scratched and stained marks left by nature are clearly visible.
        Scattered collections of cables run across the floor and intermix with the roots of the small young
        plants growing out of the seams of the broken earth, but the structure remains sturdy to the touch. The only sound is the echo of the breeze and snow.
        
    </p>
    <p>The cables on the floor coalesce, leading to the only set of doors in the room. The arched double doors have carved 
        a light floral pattern, composed by one single etched line. The material is identical to that of the walls.</p>
