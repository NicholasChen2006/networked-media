    <p>The room is illuminated with blue flowers.</p>

    <p>
        This section of the cave is neatly organized in two parts. The area to the right seems to be some kind of storage area, and the area 
        to the left is occupied by a small oven and a wooden table. On the floor, blue flowers and grass are woven into a cusion, presumably 
        for sitting.

        The wires from The Garden lead into the celing, disappearing. Emerging again behind the storage boxes, a single outlet 
        powers a tiny speaker and recieving microphone. There are drawings of mundane items sprawled across the floor.

            On the other side, a half-eaten plant rests upon the table. It's juices are staining the table blue. A <a href="the-lab-red-fruit-note.html">note</a> is in the middle of the floor.
        </p>

  <p>The <a href="the-garden.html">old wooden door</a> creaks slightly.</p>
