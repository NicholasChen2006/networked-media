        <h1>The Garden</h1>
        <p>...the heavy doors give way.</p>
        <p>
            The water flow of a stream flows down the mossy cobblestone walls, blending into blades of grass and ivy. The room is 
            illuminated by the faint heartbeat of a field of pure blue five petal flowers, arranged in clusters hanging from the cave's celing. 
            Some flowers are growing from the cracks in the walls, others cling to each other to stay connected to the dark stones above. 
            Cables from under the door to The Dome sprawl and are hung from the celing, guided from above 
            across the water and splitting into three paths. Beneath the lengths of cable are three corresponding river-stone paths that cut through the brush, evenly gleaming with the clear 
            stream's water reflecting a thousand blue flowers.
        </p>
        <p>The paths lead to three doors, connecting at one point to the path back to The Dome.</p>
        <p>The <a href="the-lab-door.html">door</a> next to the mouth of the stream. It's old and wooden, and has a note attached to its frame.</p>
        <p>A <a href="the-library-door.html">white, ornately engraved door</a>. It's bigger than the rest, placed right down the center of the split pathway.</p>
        <p>A <a href="the-bedroom-door.html">door</a> that has some unintelligble noise coming out of it. It's made of the same smooth material as the white door.</p>
        <p>A cloudy glow eminates from <a href="the-dome.html">The Dome</a>.</p>
